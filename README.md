This project was created using Next.js with Firebase as the backend. <br/>


You can try the chat with the following credentials: <br/>
Email: albert@live.it <br/>
Password: maria123 <br/>

And also: <br/>
Email: maria@live.it <br/>
Password: albert123 <br/>


For now, it only works as a chat between the two users. However, it can identify each user based on the unique user ID obtained from Firebase.
